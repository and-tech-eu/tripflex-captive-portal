This is a captive portal library for Mongoose OS, it responds to all DNS queries returning the device's IP address, as well as adding known Captive Portal endpoints for mobile/desktop devices, to allow you to serve a custom HTML file from the device, as your own custom captive portal.

## Captive Portal Stack

This is the captive portal library from the [Captive Portal WiFi Full Stack](https://github.com/tripflex/captive-portal-wifi-stack), a full stack (frontend web ui & backend handling) library for implementing a full Captive Portal WiFi with Mongoose OS

## Author
Myles McNamara ( https://smyl.es )

## Why?
You may be wondering why did I create my own, when Mongoose OS has a Captive Portal example application.  Well ... if you have used that example app you would know that it is VERY basic, and is basically just a catch-all DNS responder. It also does not have GZIP handling, support for known mobile endpoints, and many of the features included in this library.  That's why :)

## Features
- Mobile and desktop devices prompt the "Login to network" window/notification
- Support for GZIP files
- Checks device Accepts header to make sure that it supports GZIP before sending/using GZIP files
- Support for Samsung Android devices that do not follow Captive Portal 302 redirect standards

## DNS-SD Library Caveots
If you want to use the DNS-SD library in combination with this library, they both CAN NOT be enabled at the same time!  I'm digging into what is required to allow them to work at the same time, but right now, since this library requires setting up a DNS responder, it will not work with DNS-SD enabled at the same time.

The easiest solution is to just make sure that when you set `cportal.enable` to **true** -- you must also set `dns_sd.enable` to **false**

If `cportal.enable` is false, you can enable `dns_sd.enable` as the DNS responder will be disabled in this library.

## GZIP Support/Handling
This library includes support for handling, and serving GZIP files from the device to the client.  It also checks the `Accept-Encoding` header sent from the client to verify that it supports GZIP before sending the file.  To enable GZIP all you need to do is specify the index or redirect file in settings, that ends in `.gz` and this library will automatically detect that, and handle GZIP accordingly.

Any GZIP related assets (css, js, etc) will be automatically detected when they are requested (so you can just include them in your HTML file), and served as GZIP (if client supports it).

### GZIP Caveots
While using GZIP files does save a ton of space on the device -- there is a caveot to this. Some devices do not support GZIP, and if they do not, this library will not attempt to serve the GZIP file.  If the library detects that the index file is set to a GZIP file, and the client does not support GZIP,
it will instead attempt to serve `no_gzip.html` file to the client.  

You **MUST** manually add this file to your device under your `fs` directory it is not included with this library.  You can use this HTML file to notify/warn the user that the client they are using does not support GZIP and to use another device.

**It is STRONGLY recommended** if you plan on using GZIP files, to add the `no_gzip.html` file to your project!

## Settings
Check the `mos.yml` file for latest settings, all settings listed below are defaults

```yaml
  - [ "cportal.enable", "b", false, {title: "Enable WiFi captive portal on device boot"}]
  - [ "cportal.any", "b", false, {title: "Return index file for any non-hostname matching requests"}]
  - [ "cportal.ip_redirect", "b", false, {title: "Send 302 redirect to configured hostname when IP directly accessed"}]
  - [ "cportal.hostname", "s", "setup.device.portal", {title: "Hostname to use for captive portal redirect"}]
  - [ "cportal.index", "s", "index.html", {title: "Filename of HTML file to use when serving the captive portal index file"}]
  - [ "cportal.redirect_file", "s", "", {title: "(optional) filename of HTML file to use for redirect to captive portal page (must include a meta refresh tag to do redirection)"}]
```
#### `cportal.any` Setting
Enable this setting (false by default) to serve the Captive Portal index file, for any **NON** captive portal hostname requests (any request to the device, that does not match the hostname in `cportal.hostname`).

This will only serve captive portal file for any root uri requests -- meaning if request is `http://something.com/` it will serve the index file.  If the request is `http://something.com/something-else` it will not serve the index file.

If you're having trouble with devices showing the login to network, this is a setting you can enable to see if this fixes the issue (you should however report this in an issue on this repo so I can look into it)

#### `cportal.ip_redirect` Setting
Enable this setting (false by default) to send a 302 redirect to the configured hostname ( `cportal.hostname` ) when a device or browser attempts to access the device using the IP address instead of a hostname.  For example, if someone connects to wifi and uses browser to access `http://192.168.4.1/` it will send a 302 redirect to `http://setup.device.portal` (as configured in `cportal.hostname`)

This was added for supporting **stupid** Samsung Devices that do not prompt the captive portal "Login to Network" so when the user clicks on the wifi network in settings, and clicks on "Manage Router" it will open a browser for the captive portal hostname, instead of the IP address.

#### `cportal.hostname` Setting
By default this is set to `setup.device.portal` but you can change it to anything you want.  In my testing though, when testing with a `.local` domain, for some weird reason OSX (Mojave and El Captain) did not query the device for DNS to `.local` and would result in a "Could not connect" error.  This is why I have set the default as `.portal`, but you could use anything `setup.device.com`, etc, etc.

#### `cportal.redirect_file` Setting
This setting if for if you want to use your own custom HTML file as the "redirect" file sent that includes a `meta` refresh tag.  This setting is optional, and when not defined, a dynamically generated response will be sent, that looks similar to this:

```HTML
<html>
   <head>
      <title>Redirecting to Captive Portal</title>
      <meta http-equiv='refresh' content='0; url=PORTAL_URL'>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p>Please wait, refreshing.  If page does not refresh, click <a href='PORTAL_URL'>here</a> to login.</p>
   </body>
</html>
```

The `PORTAL_URL` is dynamically replaced with the value set in `cportal.hostname`.  If you use your own custom redirect HTML file, you will need to manually define the portal redirect URL in that file yourself.

**NOTE:** The important part of HTML above is the meta refresh tag:
```HTML
<meta http-equiv='refresh' content='0; url=PORTAL_URL'>
```

Make sure you include this if you use your own custom HTML redirect file, and make sure to replace `PORTAL_URL` with your captive portal hostname or URL you want to redirect the user to.  The value of `0` is how many seconds it waits before refreshing, with this set to `0` it does an immediate refresh.

## Installation/Usage

### Full Captive Portal Stack
If you want all of the features this library was built for, you should install the [Captive Portal WiFi Stack](https://github.com/tripflex/captive-portal-wifi-stack) library instead of just this one:

Add this lib your `mos.yml` file under `libs:`

```yaml
  - origin: https://github.com/tripflex/captive-portal-wifi-stack
```

### Only this library

Add this lib your `mos.yml` file under `libs:`

```yaml
  - origin: https://github.com/tripflex/captive-portal
```

### Use specific branch of library
To use a specific branch of this library (as example, `dev`), you need to specify the `version` below the library

```yaml
  - origin: https://github.com/tripflex/captive-portal
   version: dev
```

## Required Libraries
*These libraries are already defined as dependencies of this library, and is just here for reference (you're probably already using these anyways)*
- [boards](https://github.com/mongoose-os-libs/boards)
- [ca-bundle](https://github.com/mongoose-os-libs/ca-bundle)
- [http-server](https://github.com/mongoose-os-libs/http-server)

## How it works
When device boots up, if `cportal.enable` is set to `true` (default is `false`) captive portal is initialized. If `cportal.enable` is not set to `true` you must call `mgos_captive_portal_start` in C (see below for using in mjs)

## Tested Devices
These are the devices, and software versions this library has been tested with to confirm compatibilty/functionality.
- **LG-D415** Android `4.4.4` (MIUI 7)
- **Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet** (Fire OS `5.3.6.4`)
- **Pixel 3XL** (Android 9)
- **Pixel 2** (Android 9)
- **Pixel 1** (Android 9)
- **2018 Macbook Pro** (OSX Mojave `10.14.3`)

**Have you tested this library with a different device not listed here?** -- If so, **PLEASE** open a new issue, and let us know what model phone/device, and the software version so it can be added to this list!

#### Known Endpoints
Initialization enables a DNS responder for any `A` DNS record, that responds with the device's IP address.  Captive Portal also adds numerous HTTP endpoints for known Captive Portal device endpoints:
- `/mobile/status.php` Android 8.0
- `/generate_204` Android
- `/gen_204` Android
- `/ncsi.txt` Windows
- `/hotspot-detect.html` iOS/OSX
- `/hotspotdetect.html` iOS/OSX
- `/library/test/success.html` iOS
- `/success.txt` OSX
- `/kindle-wifi/wifiredirect.html` Kindle (serves index file for this request to prevent "Insecure Redirect" warning)

A root endpoint is also added, `/` to detect `CaptiveNetworkSupport` in the User-Agent of device, to redirect to captive portal.

When one of these endpoints is detected from a device (mobile/desktop), it will automatically redirect (with a `302` redirect), to the config value from `cportal.hostname` (default is `setup.device.portal`).

If on a mobile device, the user should be prompted to "Login to Wifi Network", or on desktop with captive portal support, it should open a window.

The root endpoint is also used, to detect the value in the `Host` header, and if it matches the `cportal.hostname` value, we assume the access is meant for the captive portal.  This allows you to serve HTML files via your device, without captive portal taking over the `index.html` file (but you must specify the custom file to use in `cportal.index`)

#### Samsung Device Caveots

**Short and Sweet -- Samsung SUCKS**
Samsung devices seem to be one of the only ones with captive portal issues, which I determined was due to those devices not following the standard of when a 302 redirect is returned, that is means there's a captive portal. This only happens on Samsung's modified version of Android.

See [the issue from my original Wifi Captive Portal library](https://github.com/tripflex/wifi-captive-portal/issues/7) for more details

The workaround for this is described below in how this library handles the `generate_204` endpoint for Android devices, but this doesn't work for all Samsung devices, and it seems to be a clear issue with only Samsung versions of Android that modified how Captive Portal is handled.

**Basically** what this means, is if a user's device does not prompt to login to the network, they have to click on the wifi network in settings, and then click on Manage Router. Yes it's annoying but I can't find any way to resolve this, and Samsung has not provided any help with this.  If you know how to get this working or fix this problem, **PLEASE** open an issue and let me know!
 
#### Android `/generate_204` Handling
As mentioned above -- Samsung devices suck.  The workaround for this was instead of returning a `302` redirect, to return a `200` response, with content in the response.  Most threads or questions you find online regarding this say to just return the captive portal splash page ... while this would work, this was not the approach I wanted to take.

The reason I did not want to use the above approach was because this would result in the captive portal login window that is shown on the device, showing `connectivitycheck.google.com` or something similar for the URL.  I want this to match the hostname set in configuration, and as such, instead of returning the splash page, I return a dynamically generated HTML page that includes an HTML `meta` refresh tag, that immediately refreshes the page, to the captive portal URL.  This "refresh" will be completely transparent to the end user, and will result in the device showing the correct captive portal URL.

## Available Functions/Methods

### C Functions
```C
bool mgos_captive_portal_start(void)
```

### Usage in mJS
To keep library size to a minimum, no mjs file is included with this library, but you can easily call it using the built in **ffi** for mjs, like this:
```javascript
let startCaptivePortal = ffi('bool mgos_captive_portal_start()');
startCaptivePortal();
```
